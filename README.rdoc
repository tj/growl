= Growl

Ruby growlnotify 'bindings'.

== Examples

  notification = Growl.new
  notification.message = 'Hello World'
  notification.sticky!
  notification.icon = :jpeg
  notification.run if Growl.installed?

  # OR

  Growl.notify {
    self.message = 'Hello World'
    self.icon = :jpeg
    sticky!
  }

  # OR

  Growl.notify do |n|
    n.message = 'Hello World'
    n.icon = :jpeg
    n.stick!
  end

  # OR

  Growl.notify 'Foo', :icon => :jpeg, :title => 'Growl'

  # OR

  include Growl
  notify 'Email received', :sticky => true

  # Convenience methods

  notify_ok 'Deployment successful'
  notify_info 'Email received'
  notify_warning 'Merge required'
  notify_error 'Failed to send email', :sticky => true

== Custom path to growlnotify

If needed you can set a path to the binary with:

  Growl.bin_path = '~/my/path/to/growlnotify'

right after you require the growl library.

== Normaized Icons

The :icon option key is automatically normalized when you use any of the Growl#notify
methods, this removes the need to explicitly use :appIcon, :image, etc.

  notify 'App icon', :icon => :Safari
  notify 'Jpeg icon', :icon => :jpeg
  notify 'Image icon', :icon => 'path/to/image.png'
  notify 'Icns icon', :icon => 'path/to/icon.icns'
  notify 'Path extname icon', :icon => 'foo.rb'

== Features

* Check availability with Growl.installed?
* Check dependencies with Growl.version
* Use images, icon paths, application icons, or file format icons
* Sticky a notification making it appear until explicitly closed
* Set notification priority
* Convenience methods such as notify_ok, notify_warning, notify_error, and notify_info
* Etc (consult growlnotify --help)

== Installing growlnotify

Visit http://growl.info/documentation.php for installation help.

== Known Issues

It seems that growlnotify will essentially ignore or block excessive usage
of the notifications at random. To prevent this you may need to do something like
below if you are calling many in sequence:

  notify 'Something'; sleep 0.2
  notify_ok 'Updated'; sleep 0.2
  notify_info 'You have new mail'; sleep 0.2
  notify_warning 'Merged required'; sleep 0.2
  notify_error 'Oh Noes!'; sleep 0.2
